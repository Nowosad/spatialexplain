The **spatialexplain** package provides model agnostic tools for exploring and explaining spatial machine learning models. 
This vignette shows a simple example of how to use it to explain a regression model with a few implementations of the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method.

Let's start by attaching the necessary packages, reading the predictors raster, and loading the pre-trained regression model.

```{r setup}
#| message: false
# attaching the necessary packages
library(spatialexplain)
library(terra)

# reading the predictors raster
predictors = rast("/vsicurl/https://github.com/Nowosad/IIIRqueR_workshop_materials/raw/refs/heads/main/data/predictors.tif")
plot(predictors, axes = FALSE)

# loading the pre-trained regression model
data("regr_exp", package = "spatialexplain")
regr_exp
```

The `regr_exp` object is a pre-trained regression model that was trained on the predictors raster.

The main idea behind the LIME method is to approximate the complex model with a simpler one that is easier to interpret.
The `predict_spatial_surrogate()` function explains the model using one of three implementations of the LIME method: `type = "localModel"`, `type = "iml"`, and `type = "lime"`.


The default one is the `"localModel"` method.

```{r}
regr_lime1 = predict_spatial_surrogate(regr_exp, predictors, maxcell = 500,
                                       type = "localModel")
plot(regr_lime1)
```

The second one is the `"iml"` method.

```{r}
#| message: false
regr_lime2 = predict_spatial_surrogate(regr_exp, predictors, maxcell = 500,
                                       type = "iml")
plot(regr_lime2)
```

The last one is the `"lime"` method; however, currently, it only works for explainers created with one of the supported models.

```{r}
#| error: true
regr_lime3 = predict_spatial_surrogate(regr_exp, predictors, maxcell = 500,
                                       type = "lime")
```

These different implementations use other algorithms to extract the interpretable features, have other sampling methods, and other ways of weighting.
