The goal of **spatialexplain** is to provide model agnostic tools for
exploring and explaining spatial machine learning models. It is based on
the [**DALEX**](https://modeloriented.github.io/DALEX/) package and uses
the **terra** package for spatial raster data handling.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **spatialexplain** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
